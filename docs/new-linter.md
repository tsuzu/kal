# Adding a new linter to KAL

Linters in KAL should live in their own package within the `pkg/analysis` directory.

Each linter is based on the `analysis.Analyzer` interface from the [golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis][go-analysis] package.

[go-analysis]: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis#hdr-Analyzer

The core of the linter is the `run` function, implemented with the signature:

```go
func (a *analyzer) run(pass *analysis.Pass) (interface{}, error)
```

It is recommended to implement the linter as a struct, that can contain configuration, and have the `run` function as a method on the struct.

It is also recommended to use the `inspect.Analyzer` pattern, which allows filtering the parsed syntax tree down to the types of nodes that are relevant to the linter.
This automates a lot of pre-work, and can be seen across existing linters, e.g. `jsontags` or `commentstart`.

Once you are within the `inspect.Preorder`, you can then implement the business logic of the linter, focusing on details of structs, fields, comments, etc.

## Registry

The registry in the analysis package co-ordinates the initialization of all linters.
Where linters have configuration, or are enabled/disabled by higher level configuration, the registry takes on making sure the linters are initialized correctly.

To enable the registry, each linter package must create an `Initializer` function that returns an `analysis.AnalyzerInitializer` interface (from `pkg/analysis`).

It is expected that each linter package contain a file `initializer.go`, the content of this file should be as follows:

```go
// Initializer returns the AnalyzerInitializer for this
// Analyzer so that it can be added to the registry.
func Initializer() initializer {
	return initializer{}
}

// intializer implements the AnalyzerInitializer interface.
type initializer struct{}

// Name returns the name of the Analyzer.
func (initializer) Name() string {
	return name
}

// Init returns the intialized Analyzer.
func (initializer) Init(cfg config.LintersConfig) (*analysis.Analyzer, error) {
	return newAnalyzer(cfg.MyLinterConfig)
}

// Default determines whether this Analyzer is on by default, or not.
func (initializer) Default() bool {
	return true // or false
}
```

This pattern allows the linter to be registered with the KAL registry, and allows the linter to be initialized with configuration.

Once you have created the `initializer.go` file, you will need to add the linter to the `pkg/analysis/registry.go` file.

Add the initializer to the `NewRegistry` function, and it will then be included in the linter builds.

```go
func NewRegistry() []*analysis.Analyzer {
    return []*analysis.Analyzer{
        // Add the new linter here
        mynewlinter.Initializer(),
    }
}
```

## Configuration

If the linter requires configuration, the configuration should be added to the `config` package.

Add a new structure (or structures) to the `linters_config.go` file.
Include a new field for the top level configuration to the `LintersConfig` struct, using the name of the linter, in camel case for the `json` tag.

Any options for the linter, should also be validated.
Validation lives in the `validation` package.

Within the `ValidateLintersConfig` function, in the `linters_config.go` file, you will need to add
a line as below, to include any configuration validation for the new linter.
There are already examples of this in the file.

```go
fieldErrors = append(fieldErrors, validateMyNewLint(lc.MyNewLinter, fldPath.Child("myNewLinter"))...)
```

The validations should use the `field.Error` pattern to provide consistent error messages.

## Helpers

The helpers package contains `analysis.Analyzer` implementations that can be used to source the common functionality required by linters.
For example, extracting information about `json` tags, or extracting `// +` style markers from comments.

Any new, common functionality should also be added to the helpers package.

Importantly:
* Helpers should expose a public `Analyzer` variable, of type `*analysis.Analyzer`.
* Helpers may not depend on any linter that needs to be initialized with configuration.
* Helpers themselves should not report lint issues, but should provide information to the linters that do.

In general, helpers return interfaces that can expose useful information in a simple way.
Exposing structs or maps directly as the result type of the helper means common
functions for accessing data must be implemented in each linter.

To use a helper, the helper `Analyzer` should be included in the linter `Analyzer`'s `Require` property.

```go
    return &analysis.Analyzer{
    Name:     "linterName",
    Doc:      "linter description",
    Requires: []*analysis.Analyzer{helpers.Analyzer},
    Run:      l.run,
}
```

Within the `run` function, the result of the helper can be extracted from the `*analysis.Pass` object.

```go
func (l *linter) run(pass *analysis.Pass) (interface{}, error) {
    helperResult := pass.ResultOf[helpers.Analyzer].(*helpers.ResultType)
    ...
}
```

## Tests

Basic tests can be implemented with the Go analysis test framework.

Create a `testdata` directory in the linter package and create a structure underneath.
Individual test files must be placed under `src` and then a subdirectory for each package.

Use one package per configuration input for the linter.

```
mylinter
-- mylinter.go
-- mylinter_test.go
-- testdata
  -- src
    -- a
      -- a.go
    -- b
      -- b.go
```

The test suite can then be written using the standard go test framework.

```go
func Test(t *testing.T) {
	testdata := analysistest.TestData()
	analysistest.Run(t, testdata, commentstart.Analyzer, "a")
}
```

Each file within the test package should contain Go code to test the linter.
Typically this would mean a combination of constants, type declarations and struct declarations.

Where the linter is expected to return an issue, a comment can be added to the file to indicate the expected issue.

```go
type Foo struct {
    // this comment should be flagged by the linter // Want 'comment should start with a capital letter'
    Bar string

    foo string // want 'field is not exported'
}
```

If the expected output of the test happens to contain a regex string, then the regex within the `want` comment should be escaped.
The `jsontags` linter has an example of this pattern, which can be referred to.

### With suggested fixes

Where a linter also implements suggested fixes, the test suite can be extended to include the suggested fixes.

Replace `analysistest.Run` with `analysistest.RunWithSuggestedFixes`.

```go
func Test(t *testing.T) {
	testdata := analysistest.TestData()
	analysistest.RunWithSuggestedFixes(t, testdata, commentstart.Analyzer, "a")
}
```

For each file in the test packages, a corresponding `.golden` file should be created with the expected output, once the fixes have been applied.

The `commentstart` linter has an example of this pattern, which can be referred to.

## Docs

Each linter package should contain a `doc.go` file, which has a package level comment explaining what the linter is,
what it checks for, and how it can be configured, if appropriate.

The package level documentation is helpful when running `godoc` or accessing `pkg.go.dev`.

### ReadMe

The root `README.md` file should be updated to include the new linter and any relevant information about the linter.

The format for which should look something like:

````markdown
## LinterNameInPascalCase

Include a description of what the linter is checking for.

### Fixes (via standalone binary)

Include a description of what the linter fixes, if applicable.

### Configuration

Include an example of the configuration that can be used to configure the linter, if applicable.

```yaml
lintersConfig:
  linterNameInCamelCase:
    option: value
```
````

Please add the new linter in the correct position alphabetically.
